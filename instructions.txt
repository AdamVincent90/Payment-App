Information that may help to get the app running.

- Xampp was used during development for the Apache and Mysql server.

- The mysql database name is transaction_store as stated in the env-example file (although this can be changed to whatever mysql database you create)

- The application uses Laravel and Vue js

- table migrations for users and payments are implemented - including factories and seeders for these tables. These can be run with the artisan commands

- Laravel sanctum is used for user authentication

- The env-example file should be renamed to .env

- npm install should be used to install all javascript packages and dependencies and composer install for php related dependancies 

- php artisan key:generate should be used to generate an app key for the APP-KEY var in .env file



I hope you enjoy the app! It was great fun to build!
